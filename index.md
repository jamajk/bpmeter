# Welcome to BPMeter

A simple app featuring a tap tempo tool and a metronome for musicians.
Supports dark mode.

To guarantee a good experience, the clicks that the tools make are accompanied with audio and visual feedback as well as vibrations, which can be turned on/off.

Below are screenshots from the application.
